# My-Diary

 This project is made for me personaly to clear my head of thoughts thru out the day.
 As a viewer you will get the chance to comment my posts and hopefully bring joy to my posts.

 I made this very simple yet quite agile project (I really wanna make it better in useful ways but my timebank is running out for the momment being),

 This app is all about peace and reflection.

## Features 

"What you see is what you get"
This app has a simple layout, a simple comment field with a simple tought behind it.

The navbar will direct you to the frontpage where all the posts are, as you click on the "Read me" link youÂ´ll get redirected to the post-detail page.
There you can comment and choose any nickname for the comment.
