# My-Diary

 This project is made for me personaly to clear my head of thoughts thru out the day.
 As a viewer you will get the chance to comment my posts and hopefully bring joy to my posts.

 I made this very simple yet quite agile project (I really wanna make it better in useful ways but my timebank is running out for the momment being),

 This app is all about peace and reflection.

## Features 

"What you see is what you get"
This app has a simple layout, a simple comment field with a simple tought behind it.

The navbar will direct you to the frontpage where all the posts are, as you click on the "Read me" link you´ll get redirected to the post-detail page.
There you can comment and choose any nickname for the comment.


### Existing Features

- __Navigationbar__

    Simple navigationbar that only serves one purpose, take you back where you belong ( at the frontpage reading all my posts).

    The button  "My-Diary" has a hover over effect that Bulma supply.

- __Image__

    This is a image of me looking out over the ocean, thinking about everything else than stress and time.

- __Posts__
    
    The posts is filtered from newest to oldest, with the newest starting from the top of the page

- __footer__

    Footer is provided by Bulma, the link will take you to my github page

### Features Left to Implement

I wanna make a filter tool so you can search for posts.

I wanna make a login page for visitors so that they can personally reach me if they want.


## Testing 

I´ve made some tests and testing to the site, not 100% happy with the outcome.
